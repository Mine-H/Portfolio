		<div class="content">
			<p>Hi! I am Sharkie, a uni student at the University of Staffordshire with a passion for programming and a heart for games designing.</p>
			<p>
				I've programmed as a hobby for a while now, which over the last half-decade led me to learning languages from JavaScript to Python just for the fun of it. My first encounter
				with the concept of <i>making</i> a game though was with a small showcase a town over from where I lived at the time, presenting Construct 2 as an introduction to game-making.
			</p>
			<p>
				I owe a lot of my success with programming to my A-level Computer Science teacher, who gave a lot of support to my interest in the subject and showed me examples of previous
				years' end-of-year videogame projects as inspiration and guidance. Together with my passion for games, this brought me to make my own videogame as my project using Unity
				for the first time (you might've seen a screenshot of it already, as I used it as the background for the homepage's title screen) and I haven't stopped since.
